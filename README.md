# News Site

The project for our second week was to produce a responsive news site by using CSS Flexbox, Grid and media queries. 

## The problem

I started by sketching on paper and then adding it step by step, taking the easiest part first which was HTML and then going in to the styling. I used both flexbox and grid. Flexbox for the main news item and grid for the other news items. 

If I had more time I would dig deeper into media queries as well as both Flexbox and Grid and how to combine them all in the best way to make the site even more responsive. 

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
